Python-Based Voice Assistant:

This is a voice-controlled assistant built using Python, designed to perform a range of tasks through natural language commands. The assistant's core functionality is centered around its wake-word listener, which constantly listens for a specific phrase to activate. This makes the system efficient, only processing commands after it's been triggered.


To work with this you need python extensions and make sure that all the libraries installed properly to run voice_assistant.


As it works through the wake_word listener the microphone will continuously listen for the wake_word("wake up buddy") to activate once it listens to the correct word then it will display the ui.
