Python-Based Voice Assistant:

This is a voice-controlled assistant built using Python, designed to perform a range of tasks through natural language commands. The assistant's core functionality is centered around its wake-word listener, which constantly listens for a specific phrase to activate. This makes the system efficient, only processing commands after it's been triggered.

It's interface looks like this
